This is a classic game where you play match against a CPU in a game of Pong. You receive one point when the ball gets past you opponent and vice-versa. The first to 11 points wins! This pong game is written in Python and was an excellent learning experience to better understand pygame and game development in general. 

ISSUES:
# A few glitches with ball movement

Suggestions:
# Adding a game menu where user can set difficulty
# Adding an ending screen
